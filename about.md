Hello! My name is Yuxuan Qin and I'm a senior majoring Computer Science and Data Science at NYU. I'm taking this course because I want to contribute to open source projects.

### More Information

I enjoy drawing, birding, volunteering in my free time. My profile picture is a bird called California Gnatcatcher. It is a tiny bird with a tiny range, found only in the coastal sage scrub of Southern California and Baja California.
